						Studying for math is seen as an impossible task, but that is just not true. I have compiled a list
                        of things that will help your study/preemptively study for a math test or any test.

								Despite what many think, studying for an assessment starts at the beginning of the semester. 
								The following is a list of items that will help you study when an assessment appears.
							</p>
							
							<ul class="expandedList">
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Take notes</span><br>
									Taking notes in class allows you to review information later, instead of trying to remember what the teacher has said.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Review your notes</span><br>
									Your notes will remind you of what you have forgotten.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Ask questions & get answers</span><br>
									If you don't understand something ask, your teachers are here to help you and not to torture you.
									
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Take advantage of extra credit</span><br>
									Mistakes happen, extra credit allows you to have a "buffer" zone of extra points.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Find areas you have problems with</span><br>
									You can't study if you don't know where you are making your mistakes.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Practice, practice, practice</span><br>
									Math is a skill where practice makes perfect. If you don't practice, you will not improve. 
									That's why math teachers assign homework, but sometimes homework is not enough. 
									Ask your teacher for an extra worksheet or look online for extra practice. 
									You can also look at the
									<a href="#resources">resources</a>
									 I have provided below.
									
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Ask for help, if you need it</span><br>
									If you can't figure out a problem, ask a teacher for help. That's what they are paid to do.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Use <a href="#resources">resources</a> (see list below)</span><br>
									I have compiled a list of resources for you to use, so you don't have to search the Internet.
									
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h1 class="centerText header">Upcoming Assessment</h1>
							<p class="indentPar">
								The following is a list of items that will help you study for an assessment.
							</p>
							
							<ul class="expandedList">
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Ask for the assessment format</span><br>
									Knowing if your assessment is true/false, multiple choice or short answer will help you understand how to study. 
									For instance, for multiple choice, you know that if you make a mistake, you will probably not find an answer, 
									so you would study to understand everything and not to find where your error are.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Look over your notes</span><br>
									Your notes will remind you of what you have done over the semester.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Practice!</span><br>
									Do math problems, don't just look over your notes.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Don't cram</span><br>
									Studying for an assessment in one or two days with content from a whole semester is impossible. 
									Spread out your study session over multiple days or even weeks. 
									Also, take short breaks if your study session is longer than an hour. Sometimes your brain needs a break from doing math.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Get a good night sleep before your assessment (if possible)</span><br>
									A good night sleep will reinforce what you have studied. According to 
									<a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/improve-your-memory-good-nights-sleep" target="_blank">
										National Sleep Foundation
									</a>
									, a good night's sleep will improve your memory and help you retain information for longer.
								</li>
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Don't pull an all nighter</span><br>
									Goes with the point above.
									<a href="https://www.sleep.org/articles/all-nighters-and-health/" target="_blank">
										Sleep.org
									</a>
									 states that all-nighters make it harder to concentrate, make decisions, and delay reaction time. 
									 Also, all-nighters worsen your memory.
								</li>								
								
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Use <a href="#resources">resources</a> (see list below)</span><br>
									Look below; I have compiled resources for you to use.
