            This project is a video game for the PC. This game gets its inspiration from 
            &lt;a href="https://www.factorio.com/"&gt;Factorio&lt;/a&gt;, 
            &lt;a href="https://lincity.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Lincity&lt;/a&gt;, and 
            &lt;a href="https://rimworldgame.com/"&gt;RimWorld&lt;/a&gt;. 
            It is a 2D civiliation manager. 
            The player must manage their resources and keep their people happy as they progress through a technology tree 
            and make their factories more complex.

            Inspired by some friends in speech class, 
            this project main focus is to learn more about web development and security. 
            The other goal of this project is to have a place where my friends and I can chat online through without signing into social media.
